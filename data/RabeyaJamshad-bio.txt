Rabeya Jamshad is a Ph.D. student in the Healthcare Robotics Lab at UC San Diego and is advised by Dr. Laurel Riek. Her work has looked into developing robots that can support human teams in dynamic, fast-paced, and uncertain environments. It lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence, robotics, and team research. In her work, she has also designed experiments in collaboration with cognitive science researchers to support the understanding and design of human-robot teams. She has also worked with stakeholders such as clinicians to design robots that support their tasks in the emergency department. Before joining UC San Diego, Rabeya completed her M.Sc. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology as a Fulbright Scholar where she was advised by Dr. Ayanna Howard. She earned her B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from LUMS, Pakistan. She is also a recipient of the Powell Fellowship at UC San Diego 2021.
